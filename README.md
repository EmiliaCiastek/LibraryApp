# LibraryApp

* Before run you need to provide backend library api url:

    1. Create file: app/src/main/res/raw/config.properties (it's not tracked by git)
    2. Put value for key: `api_url`

* `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` - this flag in manifest is temporary because of lack of https in backend api
